#Your Moving Companion

Your moving companion uses AJAX and the Google Street View Image, The New York Times Article
Search, and MediaWiki APIs to provide the user information about a particular address.

When the user inputs a street address and city, an image of the Street View of that address loads in the background.
In addition, a list of New York Times articles and a list of relevant Wikipedia articles are generated for the city.
